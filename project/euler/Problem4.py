"""
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
"""
"""
A quick thought, all products of 3digits by 3 digits will be a a 6 digit number, thus
our search space will be [100000, 998001].   We can just check brute force in that domain.
 Doh... Nope, there's no guarantee that the number found is actually a multiple of two three
 digit numbers....
